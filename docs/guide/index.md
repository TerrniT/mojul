# Getting Started with Mojul

Mojul is a minimalistic CSS framework that provides utility classes similar to Tailwind CSS but with a more streamlined approach.

## What is Mojul?

Mojul focuses on providing essential utility classes for common CSS properties like margins, paddings, and colors. The framework follows a simple naming convention that makes it intuitive to use.

## Basic Usage

```html
<div class="mt-4 pb-2 bg-primary">
  This div has a margin-top of 4 units, padding-bottom of 2 units,
  and a primary background color.
</div>
```

## Core Principles

1. **Minimalistic**: Only includes the most commonly used utilities
2. **Intuitive**: Simple naming conventions that are easy to remember
3. **Lightweight**: Small footprint for faster loading times
4. **Customizable**: Easy to extend with your own utilities
